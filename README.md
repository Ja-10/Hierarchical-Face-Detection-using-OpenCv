# Hierarchical-Face-Detection-using-OpenCv
Face detection is a type of computer vision technology that is able to identify peopleâ€™s faces within digital images.
Smile detention is a subset of facial recognition technology and it is to ensure that people are in a good mood when they are being photographed.

This project utilises the Haar Cascade Classifier.The Haar Cascade Classifier is a pre-trained classifier having a cascade function which is trained from a set of images with faces and images without faces.In this project the face,eyes and smile of the person are detected.
